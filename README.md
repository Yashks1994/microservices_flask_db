Docker and Flask_DB Project
This Simple Project will help you deploy a flask application with MYSQL database.

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
Flask
mysql-connector
docker-compose

Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running
As in the app dir the requirements.txt file is given.

Now after installing the docker-compose
Run the following commands.

$ docker-compose up

You can see the image being built, the packages installed according to the requirements.txt, etc. If everything went right, you will see the following line:

app_1  |  * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

We can find out that everything is running as expected by typing this url in a browser or using curl, and receiving the following response:

$ curl http://0.0.0.0:5000/
{"favorite_colors": [{"Lancelot": "blue"}, {"Galahad": "yellow"}]}


You can access the database directly using the mysql client and following command (make sure your client is the same version of MySQL specified in the docker-compose.yml):

Before that install the following dependencies for Unix:
sudo apt install mysql-client-core-5.7   
sudo apt install mariadb-client-core-10.1

Then,
$ mysql --host=127.0.0.1 --port=32000 -u root -p

Below are the basic SQL commands.
MySQL [(none)]> show databases ;
